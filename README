## Inspiration
While discussing project ideas we settled on a studying website but we weren’t sure what to make of it yet. I then mentioned one of my favourite focus websites, _“I Miss My Café”_, which plays ambient sounds to create a relaxing space. After that we kept listing more of our favourite methods of studying and we eventually came up with what is now StudySpace.

## What it does
StudySpace is a  website that helps you memorize material with flashcards while also letting you create a space that suits your  needs. You can adjust the ambiance with different sound options and set a timer for your breaks and study sessions, so it’s all about shaping the study experience to your personal preferences.

## How we built it
We built StudySpace using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since most of us (if not, all of us) were beginners in front-end development, everything was brand new, so we had a lot to learn along the way. It was a fun challenge to bring back-end style thinking into the front-end world and see it all come together.
